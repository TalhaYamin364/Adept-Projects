Expense Tracker Application

A simple command-line application for tracking personal expenses.
Users can add expenses, view all expenses, calculate totals, and filter by category.

This module demonstrates:
- Functional programming with map() and filter()
- User input handling and validation
- Basic data management with dictionaries and lists
